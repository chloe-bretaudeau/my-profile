		<h2>Travelling around the world</h2>

		<p>
			I had the chance to travel a lot during my childhood, I lived in Santo Domingo, in Tokyo and in Bangkok, for 4 years each, before arriving in Chantilly, in France, 5 years ago. Moreover, my family and I went on vacations in the countries around where we were standing, so we visited quite a lot of wonderful places. I'm now in Lille for almost 5 years of studies, but I truelly am passionate about travelling around the world, getting to know new cultures, lanscapes and people.

		<h2>Practicing sports</h2>

		<p>
			Sports are my others passions, I have been practising a lot of different types of sports, like tennis, swimming, judo, dance... but my favourite one is the Volley-Ball, and especially the Beach Volley-Ball which I've been practising with my family and friends since I was old enough to hold a baloon in my hands.

		<h2>Hanging out with friends</h2>

		<p>
			This could sounds cliché, but what I enjoy the most doing during my free time is hanging out with my friends, or talking to them thanks to the social media. Indeed, I still regularly am in contact with friends I've made in Thailand or Japan, even if we were young, and I've met some of them several times since we have moved apart. Friends are really important to me, and I am so gratefull of having them.
